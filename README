Note: due to a variety of factors (mostly miscommunication), we were not able to complete the assignment.
In addition, everyone was busy this past week with midterms and other projects. While this is no excuse,
we expect that we will have more time in the coming week to commit to this course.
It is worth noting that a large majority of the work load so far has been handled by only two group members.

These are all issues that we will fix as we complete this assignment and move on to Part III.
